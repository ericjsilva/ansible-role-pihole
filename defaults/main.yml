# pihole_privacylevel
# 0 = Show everything and record everything
#     Gives maximum amount of statistics
# 1 = Hide domains: Display and store all domains as "hidden"
#     This disables the Top Domains and Top Ads tables on the dashboard
# 2 = Hide domains and clients: Display and store all domains as "hidden" and all clients as "0.0.0.0"
#     This disables all tables on the dashboard
# 3 = Anonymous mode: This disables basically everything except the live anonymous statistics
#     No history is saved at all to the database, and nothing is shown in the query log. Also, there are no top item lists.
# 4 = No Statistics mode: This disables all statistics processing. Even the query counters will not be available.
#     Note that regex blocking is not available when query analyzing is disabled.
#     Additionally, you can disable logging to the file /var/log/pihole.log using `sudo pihole logging off`.
